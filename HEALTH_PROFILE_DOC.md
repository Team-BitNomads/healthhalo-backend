# Health Profile API Documentation

This API allows authenticated users to **retrieve** and **update** their health profile. The system uses this data to compute a `risk_level` score based on medical, lifestyle, and family history factors.

---

## üîí Authentication

All requests require a valid **JWT access token** in the `Authorization` header.

**Header format:**
```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

The token should be retrieved from login and stored securely in localStorage or memory. Example in React:

```js
const token = localStorage.getItem("access_token");
const headers = {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
};
```

---

## üìç Endpoint

**URL:** `/api/health-sub/`  
**Methods Supported:** `GET`, `PUT`  
**Requires Authentication:** ‚úÖ Yes (JWT)  
**Content-Type:** `application/json` (for PUT)

---

## üì§ GET Request

### ‚úÖ Retrieve your health profile

React Fetch Example:
```js
fetch("/api/health-sub/", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("access_token")}`
  }
})
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

---

## üì• PUT Request

### ‚úèÔ∏è Create or update your health profile

If a profile doesn't exist, one will be created automatically. This request **must include all fields**.

import axios from 'axios';
